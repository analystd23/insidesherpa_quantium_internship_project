##Quantium Data Analytics Virtual Experience
Completed a hands-on virtual internship simulating the role of a data analyst at Quantium. Using R, I explored customer transaction data, performed A/B testing, and delivered commercial insights. Key highlights:
- Data Cleaning & Exploration: Transformed raw datasets, handled outliers, and extracted key features like brand and pack size.
- Customer Segmentation: Analyzed purchasing behavior across demographics to identify high-value segments.
- Experimentation & Uplift Modeling: Designed and evaluated store layout trials using statistical testing in R.
- Business Recommendations: Presented data-driven insights to support strategic retail decisions.
This experience sharpened my skills in R programming, data visualization, and statistical analysis, while reinforcing my ability to turn data into actionable business value.
